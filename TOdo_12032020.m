%          If I’ve selected anything other than 30, 
%          I can’t score, but I can cycle through the 
%          epochs at the longer time intervals.  For example, 
%          if I have 120 selected, that’s 2 minutes of scoring.  
%          There should be 4 sleep stages in that time period.  
%          If it’s already been scored then displaying the stage 
%          for those 4 sections (perhaps superimposed in a 
%          semi-transparent large number across the epoch) 
%          would be helpful.  If I hit the forward button 
%          while in 120s epoch mode, then it would forward 
%          the display showing the next 2 minutes of data.
